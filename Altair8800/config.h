// Setting this to 1 enables profiling.  To use profiling, enable
// serial debug input (switch 5 on during reset) and then send 'F'
// (without quotes) over serial. From that point, every second a
// message will be printed to serial indicating the number of executed 
// instructions, 8080 cycles, time and performance in MHz.
// Reduces performance and uses 14 bytes of RAM when enabled.
#define USE_PROFILING 1


// If USE_PROFILING is enabled, setting USE_PROFILING_DETAIL to 1 
// will (every 10 seconds) show a list of which opcodes were executed 
// how many times.
// Reduces performance and uses 1k of RAM

// Enables function of the PROTECT/UNPROTECT switches.
// Reduces performance and uses 33 bytes of RAM.

// Enables support for IRQs. Only emulation of "receive" interrupts
// generated by the 2SIO card when receiving serial data is implemented.

// If enabled, Address switch state will be set by issuing the '/'
// serial command.  Actual switches will be ignored.
// Useful when operating while not connected to the front panel hardware.
