Three examples of reading the serial buffer after determining the number of bytes present using the Serial.available() function:

==> Loop read byte by byte w/o storing data

==> Loop read byte by byte and store in a variable

==> Read to variable as a block looking for a
terminator character, a fixed number of bytes
or until a timeout after all the data is in
