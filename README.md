# CodeBender Code

This is most of my (and other peoples) code from CodeBender.

## Installation

TODO: Describe the installation process

## Usage

Some of this code is just test/snippets, some of it was already moved to github, but was also on codebender for history. some of it is other peoples code, if I know where it came from I tried to put that information with it. Some of it (most I would think) is my code. I wanted to save what I could, this seemed like the best way to do it.
Some of my personal libraries are also here.
